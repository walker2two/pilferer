// This file contains the implementation of Go channels.

// Invariants:
//  At least one of c.sendq and c.recvq is empty,
//  except for the case of an unbuffered channel with a single goroutine
//  blocked on it for both sending and receiving using a select statement,
//  in which case the length of c.sendq and c.recvq is limited only by the
//  size of the select statement.
//
// For buffered channels, also:
//  c.qcount > 0 implies that c.recvq is empty.
//  c.qcount < c.dataqsiz implies that c.sendq is empty.
